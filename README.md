## About The Project

The Hexmodal is a modal synth that is aimed at adding a bit more physicality to physical modeling. The whole device is played with two hands where the left hand determines the left hand determines the frequencies of the resonator and the right acts as the exciter for the sound. This comes together to provide a tactile experience with lots of feedback and opportunity for experimentation.

This repository holds the Pure Data patch and Arduino sketch that was made for Hexmodal.
